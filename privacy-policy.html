        </h1>
        <P>
            We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in
            new ways. Our services include:
            Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home.Platforms like the Chrome browser and
            Android operating system
            Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps
        </P>

        <p>
            You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a
            Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search
            results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all,
            like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos.
            You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your
            browsing private from other people who use your device.
            And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of
            data and how we use it.
        </p>

        <p> We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like
            which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who
            matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how
            that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.
            When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers
            tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your
            preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant
            search results or ads based on your activity.
            When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as
            personal information.
